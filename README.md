# Python Debugging Puzzles

Welcome to the Python Debugging Puzzles repository! This is a unique learning resource aimed at Python enthusiasts who wish to sharpen their coding skills by diving headfirst into the world of debugging and error resolution.


## About This Repository

- This repository is a curated collection of Python puzzles, each intentionally laced with common errors that Python developers encounter. These range from syntax mistakes to logical errors and incorrect use of functions. The goal is to provide a hands-on approach to understanding Python's error messages (tracebacks) and to develop the skills necessary to resolve them.


## Who is this for?

-  **Beginners** who have just started learning Python and want to understand common pitfalls.
-  **Intermediate** learners who wish to improve their debugging skills.
-  **Educators** looking for practical materials to teach Python programming and problem-solving.


## Features

-  **Puzzles of Varying Difficulty:** From simple syntax errors to more complex logical issues.
-  **Traceback Analysis:** Learn to read and understand Python's error messages.
-  **Solutions Branch:** Each puzzle comes with a solution in a separate branch for you to check your answers.
-  **Incremental Learning:** Puzzles are ordered by difficulty to gradually enhance your debugging skills.
-  **Community Input:** Contributions are welcome! Add your own puzzles and solutions.


## Getting Started

-  **Clone the Repository:** Get a local copy of the puzzles to work on your machine.
-  **Choose a Puzzle:** Start with the first puzzle or jump to one that matches your current skill level.
-  **Run the Code:** Execute the code and encounter an error.
-  **Debug:** Use the traceback to identify the error and fix it.
-  **Learn:** Understand the mistake and learn why the error occurred.
-  **Repeat:** Move on to the next puzzle and continue learning!
